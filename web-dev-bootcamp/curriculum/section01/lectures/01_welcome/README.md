# Welcome to the course!

Thank you for enrolling in this course! I hope you'll enjoy it!

Feel free to watch the Udemy videos while reading this e-book. Also, remember to code along with me if you're following the videos.

When you've gone through the course, you should practice what you've learned by building other, similar projects to what we build in the course.

After that, you'll definitely be ready to tackle any project you want!
