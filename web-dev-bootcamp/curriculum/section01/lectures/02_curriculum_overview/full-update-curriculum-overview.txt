Hey guys, welcome to the course! Let me tell you a bit about how this course is going to go.

The first 7 sections of this course are essential, and they will set you up for success.

You're now in section 1, a short section to get you started. Section 2 is the Python refresher. You should go through this if you're new to Python. If you're not new to Python, feel free to skip the lectures you already know. I recommend looking through and see if there's something you do want to revise.

Sections 3 and 4 cover HTML and CSS, and you'll build your first project. Even if you already know HTML and CSS, don't skip these sections. That’s because we cover many topics that just aren’t talked about all that often in most HTML and CSS courses! For example, HTML content categories or the CSS box model in depth. You can always use the Udemy playback speed control to go through videos faster if you want to.

Throughout sections 5 to 7, we will design and code the microblog project, which is the first full-stack project in this course. To do this, you'll learn even more HTML and CSS, you'll start using Flask with Python for server-side development, and you'll get acquainted with MongoDB for data storage.

After that, in all the sections after that, we'll build the rest of the projects in the course. I won't talk too much about them since you've already seen them in the first video of this course!

Throughout the entire course you really should code alongside me. Don't copy-paste code! Certainly, don't just watch the videos. If you code with me and you make changes to the projects and play around with the code as you along, you'll learn way more than if you just watch the videos.

I'm really excited to take you through this course.

Let's get started!
