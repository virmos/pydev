# Curriculum overview

In this course you'll learn about making web applications using HTML, CSS, Flask, and MongoDB. 

You can see on the left a breakdown of the sections.

We'll start with a Python refresher, which covers a lot of important Python topics. Feel free to skip some or all of this if you are already familiar with Python.

Then, we'll look at website basics, HTML, and CSS. After, we'll build our first project and learn about backend development and deployments.

Following that, you'll start learning about Jinja in depth. Jinja is a library that makes web development with Flask a breeze!

The rest of the content in this course is still something we're working on!
