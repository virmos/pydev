# How to install Python on your computer <!-- omit in toc -->

- [On Windows](#on-windows)
- [On Mac](#on-mac)

In this lecture I'll guide you through installing Python on your computer. If have already installed Python, feel free to skip to the next lecture!

## On Windows

To install Python, download the latest version of Python  from https://www.python.org. At the time of writing, that was Python 3.9.6.

::: danger Add to PATH
As you go through the installer, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".
:::

Once Python is installed, you can execute the program `cmd.exe`. This is a command-line interface to your computer. Here, just type the word `python` and that will start the Python program.

At all points during the course, you can always type `python name_of_file.py` and that will execute the code of a file called `name_of_file.py`

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, such as a version you installed a while ago, you'll need to use the complete path to Python in order to run it. Usually it'll look something like this:

```
C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python39-32\\python.exe
```

## On Mac

To install Python, download the latest version of Python  from https://www.python.org. At the time of writing, that was Python 3.9.6.

Once Python is installed, you can execute the program `Terminal.app`. This is a command-line interface to your computer. Here, just type the word `python3.9` and that will start the Python program.

At all points during the course, you can always type `python3.9 name_of_file.py` and that will execute the code of a file called `name_of_file.py`
