# Deploying our app to Heroku

1. Create a Heroku account
2. Create a Heroku app (mine named `python-web-microblog`)
3. Create a GitHub account
4. Create a **private** GitHub repository (the MongoDB user and password *will* be visible online if they don't choose the private repository). If you can't create private repositories, in the next video we'll look at how to hide the MongoDB details.
5. Add files via upload
    1. All the project files.
6. Connect the Heroku app to GitHub.
7. Add the repository.
8. Deploy the `main` branch in Heroku.
