# Step 3: Wireframing or Rough Design

For every backlog item that we're tackling, I like to start with a wireframe or a rough design of what it will look like and the functionality we'll achieve by implementing it.

Since we know we're making a website, I'll make a wireframe of what elements the site should have.

We've decided users will be able to create journal entries which contain text and the date in which they were posted.

When an entry is created, we can get the "current date" at that time, so the user doesn't need to enter a date when they submit an entry. All we need is the content:
