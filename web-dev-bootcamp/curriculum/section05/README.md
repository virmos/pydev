# Page Style with CSS

In this section we're going to learn how to modify the appearance of our websites using CSS (**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets). CSS is a tricky area for a lot of front end developers, and unfortunately has a somewhat bad reputation. It's often used poorly, largely because people don't spend the time to properly understand the language.

When properly leveraged, CSS is an extremely powerful tool that can produce complex and engaging visuals, and even animations, with very little code.

These aesthetic changes are also largely detached from the HTML we used to describe our pages, which allows us to keep our styling and markup distinct and separate.

I recommend you take a look at a site called [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/), which serves as great a demonstration of the power and versatility of CSS. Hopefully this will inspire you to dive deep into the language and truly master its fundamental features.

Let's get started!
